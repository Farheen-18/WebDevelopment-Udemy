<h1>Farheen's Movie List</h1>
<h2>Movies that I watched in July 2024</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
  <h3>1. Wonka</h3>
  This is part 2 of Wonka. I was feeling like watching it from a long time (recommendation by someone).<br/>
  Honestly, I was not feeling 'so good' earlier, but the movie changed everything. Absolutely loved every part of it. <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <h3>2. Willy Wonka's chocolate factory</h3>
  I have seen this so many times lol. But still like watching it once again :) 
</p>
<p>
  <h3>3. Indide Out 2<br/></h3>
  I watched this for the first time. <br/>
  This movie is the continuation of Inside Out. It is when new emotions start to appear when the girl becomes a teenager.<br/>
  It also describes how difficult it becomes to control one's emotion.<br/>
  I loved watching the movie. I feel such movies helps to realise what I am personally feeling too.

  <h3>4. Home Alone<br/></h3>
  I am watching this movie for the 100th time.<br/>
  I love this movie because I laugh throughout while watching it. Hehe <br/>
</p>
<p> 
  <h3>5. Slumdog millionaire<br/></h3>
  I watched it for the first time. (Movie recommendation by someone)<br/>
  I loved this movie. This was thrilling but at the same time very saddening.<br/>
  This is based on real life (except the question and lottery part ofc) even if it is not based on real life. (iykyk) <br/>
  I am hoping this changes. Though I know it would not and we would not be able to save those lives (the most sad self reflection).<br/>
  But still hope to create some impact. <br/>
