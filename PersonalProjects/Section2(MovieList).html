  <h3> <li><a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6166392/">Wonka</a></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This is part 2 of Wonka. I was feeling like watching it for a long time (recommendation by someone).</li>
    <li>Honestly, I was not feeling 'so good' earlier, but the movie changed everything. Absolutely loved every part of it.</li>
  </ul>
 
</p>
<p>
  <h3><li><a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/">Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory </a></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I have seen this so many times lol. But I still like watching it once again :) </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h3><li><a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22022452/" >Indide Out 2</a></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I watched this for the first time.</li>
    <li>This movie is the continuation of Inside Out. It is when new emotions start to appear when the girl becomes a teenager.</li>
    <li>It also describes how difficult it becomes to control one's emotions.</li>
    <li>I loved watching the movie. I feel such movies help me realize what I am personally feeling too.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h3><li><a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099785/">Home Alone</a></li></h3>
  <ul> 
  <li> I am watching this movie for the 100th time.</li>
  <li> I love this movie because I laugh throughout while watching it. Hehe</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p> 
  <h3><li><a href ="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_slumdog%2520m">Slumdog millionaire</a></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I watched it for the first time. (Movie recommendation by someone)</li>
    <li>I loved this movie. This was thrilling but at the same time very saddening.</li>
    <li>This is based on real life (except the question and lottery part ofc) even if it is not based on real life. (iykyk)</li>
    <li>I am hoping this changes. Though I know it would not and we would not be able to save those lives (the saddest self-reflection)</li>
    <li>But still hope to create some impact.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
